Let me state some facts:
- __The size of our digital existence is correlated to the amount of work we publish online__: there is no such thing as silence on the internet. When you stay quiet online, the void is filled by other people, and you slowly disappear. This is truer in the age of the feed.

- __There is a tacit understanding that whatever we publish is rigorous__: unlike casual conversations, there's a feeling that writing cannot be used for thinking out loud. Everything you put online, can be used against you.

- __Matching interesting ideas with corresponding rigour is costly__: taking ourselves too seriously can be what's stopping us from appearing in public.

For these reasons, I will be prefacing some of my posts in this blog with an epistemic status tag. It's a way for me to hedge my claims, which in turn gives me the confidence to publish.

It will be categorised in two dimensions: applicability and effort. If I think whatever I've written applies to every relevant case, it'll be deemed _Generalizable_, otherwise, they'll be _Specific_. As for effort, it'll just disclose the amount of effort that I feel I've put into evaluating my own claims.

The main takeaway is to consider my blog to be work-in-progress. The best way to learn is to learn in public, and I want to be able to make mistakes without regretting them. In any case, my post update history is always public on [Github](https://github.com/faurehu/faurehu.github.io/tree/master/_posts).
