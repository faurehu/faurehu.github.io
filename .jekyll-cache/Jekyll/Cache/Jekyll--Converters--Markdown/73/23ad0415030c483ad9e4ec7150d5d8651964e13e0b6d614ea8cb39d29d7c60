I"±<p>Ok, we get it. You‚Äôve been told by a techie friend who also happens to be very busy that if you opt for hiring an agency to build your MVP, you‚Äôll end up with technical debt. Whatever it means, it‚Äôs not good for you and you need to find a co-founder who understands all this technical gibberish and will land your ideas into reality so you can finally start cashing in on that visionary talent you were born with.</p>

<p>I was going to write a post titled ‚ÄúHow to Convince Someone to be your Technical Cofounder‚Äù, but I decided it‚Äôd be much less insulting to anyone reading if I just wrote a rant about specific people I tend to come across at technology meetups. The ones on a romantic search for a partner to make their illusions come true. Their pitch might not be crass and the idea could have potential, but when asked about the progress done so far they say it‚Äôs not possible to do anything until they have something to sell, and so they need someone to build it first so they can get started.</p>

<p>No one is ever going to join your team if you keep that mentality.</p>

<p>The current macroenvironment has disbalanced supply and demand. Experienced developers are scarce, and they are already earning six figure wages. Ideas are cheap, execution is hard. Teams are crucial and no one is going to jump ship to join your unexistant startup if you can‚Äôt show your worth.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt ask for someone to be your technical cofounder, instead, brag about your project. Anyone slightly interested will ask you about the status of your product and you can mention that you‚Äôre waiting for the right talent to ask to build it with you. For now, you‚Äôre doing everything else, and that‚Äôs a lot to handle too!</p>

<p>Be ready to receive feedback. If you don‚Äôt get any, ask for it. No one‚Äôs going to identify with every detail in your vision right after your pitch. There‚Äôs going to be that lukewarm sensation but there‚Äôll be some details people will want to polish so they can start feeling a sense of ownership. Almost right away, developers will start thinking about how to build the product and point out the pain points, pay attention to these.</p>

<p>Whatever qualifications you have, make them visible. Get their email address and shoot whatever material you have. If you‚Äôre a project manager these should be user profiles and stories. If you‚Äôre an UX designer show your journeys, sketches and wireframes. It‚Äôs nice you met your charity fundraising goals before the marathon, but if you don‚Äôt have a pitch deck then you‚Äôre not really running. Ideally, you‚Äôd have all of this ready but hey, a display of elbow grease will do.</p>

<p>It also helps to show your thinking. Mention how you‚Äôve arrived to the conclusion that he or she is the one. When did you first witness synergy? How have you tested their skills? What made their passion noticeable? If you‚Äôll take anybody who can write code then you‚Äôre evidently desperate. You‚Äôre not just looking for a codemonkey to lay bricks, you need somebody to own the mission with you.</p>

<p>These tips should help anyone not only to entice people to join their team, but most importantly, to not annoy the hell out of people.</p>
