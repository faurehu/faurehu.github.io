I"<p>Let me state some facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The size of our digital existence is correlated to the amount of work we publish online</strong>: there is no such thing as silence on the internet. When you stay quiet online, the void is filled by other people, and you slowly disappear. This is truer in the age of the feed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There is a tacit understanding that whatever we publish is rigorous</strong>: unlike casual conversations, thereâ€™s a feeling that writing cannot be used for thinking out loud. Everything you put online, can be used against you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Matching interesting ideas with corresponding rigour is costly</strong>: taking ourselves too seriously can be whatâ€™s stopping people from appearing in public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, I will be prefacing my posts in this blog with an epistemic status tag. Itâ€™s a way for me to hedge my claims, which in turn gives me the confidence to publish.</p>

<p>It will be categorised in two dimensions: applicability and effort. If I think whatever Iâ€™ve written applies to every relevant case, itâ€™ll be deemed â€œ<em>Generalizable</em>â€, otherwise, theyâ€™ll be â€œ<em>Specific</em>â€. As for effort, itâ€™ll just disclose the amount of effort that I feel Iâ€™ve put into evaluating my own claims.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is to consider my blog to be work-in-progress. The best way to learn is to learn in public, and I want to be able to make mistakes without regretting them. In any case, my post update history is always public on <a href="https://github.com/faurehu/faurehu.github.io/tree/master/_posts">Github</a>.</p>
